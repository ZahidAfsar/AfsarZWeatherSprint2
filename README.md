// What i did today was work on the day and night check field and made it work with javascript. I finished the design and made the pages all linked up. Made my fetches organized and had it display in the html and console.

// Plans for (12/6/23) 
//What I plan to do tommorow is start to work on the favorite page and the search bar. I also plan to get the icon to work for the current weather to match with the weather condition. If I have extra time make the date and time display correctly.
