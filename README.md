//Built out the weather app from the figma
//Peer reviewed by :
// What I did today (12/4/23) : Made the basic layout of the figma and got the favorite page to link. Also got to fetch the data from the api. Console logged the data that I need for the current day and high and low temp
// What I plan to do tommorow (12/5/23) : Get the data from next five days to be organized in the console. Finish the design and have all pages linked up together including the day/night mode.
