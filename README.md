// What i did today was work on the day and night check field and made it work with javascript. I finished the design and made the pages all linked up. Made my fetches organized and had it display in the html and console.

// Plans for (12/6/23) 
//What I plan to do tommorow is start to work on the favorite page and the search bar. I also plan to get the icon to work for the current weather to match with the weather condition. If I have extra time make the date and time display correctly.

// What I did today was during the time before lunch I added the pages folder and that made the day/might mode no longer working. So I got help from developer and spent the time fixing it. After Lunch I worked on the search bar and have it semi-functional still need to make it only accept city names input and nothing else. I also made it start from Los Angeles on load due to the clients needs. 

// Plans for (12/7/23)
//What I plan for tommorrow is to make the favorites page and have it save to local storage. I also plan to compelete the search bar. I may also work on the Date and Time api fetch and have it display in the html.

// Plans for (12/8/23)
